1. css variables
2. when value is 0 do not use unit (0px)
3. with animations use ms it is more readable (0.2s === 200ms)
4. use media query breakpoints provided by big companies like BS and Tailwind ( and variables for them)
5. remove image path from db.js, only image name + extension
6. add image in jsx as imports ( import image from '../../.png' <img scr={image} /> )
